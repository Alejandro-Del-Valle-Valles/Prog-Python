# AI Agent Guidelines for this Repository

This file provides instructions for AI agents (GitHub Copilot, Cursor, GPTs) interacting with this codebase.

## 1. Context & Developer Profile
- **Project:** Python Development Repository (Multiplatform Application Development student).
- **Primary Language:** Python 3.11.9
- **Developer Level:** Junior/Student.

## 2. Coding Standards (Mandatory)
When generating or refactoring code, you MUST follow these rules:

- **Language:** All code, including variable names, functions, and classes, must be in **Spanish**.
- **Dependencies (Libs, Frameworks, etc):** If an exercise requires a dependency, create a virtual environment to install it.
- **Documentation:** Every function and class must include a Docstring or Header explaining its purpose.
- **Complexity:** Prefer clean, readable code over complex one-liners. As a student, I value understanding the logic.
- **Type Hinting:** Use Python type hints (e.g., `def name(param: str) -> int:`) whenever possible.

## 3. Interaction Preferences
- **Response Language:** Please provide explanations and chat responses in **Spanish (Castellano)**.
- **Formatting:** Use clear Markdown and bold key terms.
- **Suggestions:** If you see a way to improve the performance, suggest it but explain the "why" behind the optimization.

## 4. Project Structure Reference
- `/Tema_XX`: Group Exercises for each unit.
- `/PracticaXX`: Contains the code of each exercise.

**Note:** These instructions are high priority. If a request contradicts these guidelines, point it out before proceeding.
